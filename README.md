# M5Stack_Atom_Digole_Screen
A basic way of quickly integrating the M5Stack Atom to the Digole range of screens.

M5Stack offer a lot of modules with built in screens, but you may have one of their super-compact "Atom" ESP32 modules.                
These have several IO pin-holes, as well as a nice and tindy "grove" connector just above the USB-C port.            

This little project shows you what you need to edit in the Digole Arduino sketch to use the lightweight ESP32 hardware serial user-defined pins for the screen's UART mode.     
It also uses a grove breakout cable to show you how tidy the solution can be, no loose wires all over the place. =)

You'll need:
